# A Data Science Approach to Predicting Realized Volatility of Options

## Background Summary
This project aims to utilize modern machine learning techniques to run prediction experiments for predicting the realized volatility (RV) of options, focusing on the QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF). Accurately predicting RV opens opportunities for statistical arbitrage that trading firms can capitalize on to make a profit. It is a consulting project with a small multi-strategy proprietary trading and market-making firm based in New York, in collaboration with USC. 

The datasets utilized in this project were provided by the firm and are proprietary in nature. Access to these datasets is highly restricted and would be challenging to obtain without the appropriate resources and connections of the firm. You can view a sample dataset in this repository; however, the complete datasets cannot be shared online due to their proprietary status.

## Challenge
Identifying anomalies or mispricing in the listed options markets has intensified over the past the years Traditional methods depend heavily on mathematical models. This project proposes a paradigm shift towards a data-driven approach, employing advanced machine learning models for more accurate volatility forecasting.

## Stages of the Project

### 1. Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dataset included 700+ predictors, including a suite of variables that could predict volatility: commodities, equities, bonds, future contracts, interest rate products, macroeconomic variables, etc. We selected a time-frame from 2005 to 2022 to encompass various market cycles, resulting in a high-dimensional and comprehensive dataset.
* Data Integration: All variables, including the target, were in different datasets. We tackled the challenge of merging time-series data in chronological order.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): It was challenging to identify underlying patterns between the target and other variables. We categorized variables into groups and performed EDA, focusing on visualization and correlation analysis.

### 2. Preprocessing
* Imputation: We imputed null values to ensure data completeness.
* Outlier Treatment: Outliers were addressed using winsorization to limit extreme values.
* Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques such as LASSO and PCA were employed to identify principal components, defining relevant features and reducing the dataset's size.

### 3. Model Development and Evaluation
We employed various machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, and Lasso Regression. The models were rigorously trained, and Cross Validation techniques were pplied to select the best model. The selected models were then backtested and evaluated on historical data.

### 4. Trading Strategy and Deployment
Using the forecasts and insights obtained from the models, we formulated a real-time trading strategy. While the implementation of the trading strategy was outside the project's scope, the predictions from the ML models provided the foundation for developing a robust trading strategy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques for predicting realized volatility in options markets. The shift from traditional mathematical models to a data-driven approach offers the promise of more accurate volatility forecasting, paving the way for profitable trading strategies.
